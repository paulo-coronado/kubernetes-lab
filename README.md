# Introdução ao Kubernetes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/kube101.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/kube101)

This repository contains introductory material for Kubernetes.

There is a presenter-run [meetup], including [automated scripts] for running a demonstration of Kubernetes as provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. This should take from 45 minutes to an hour and a half based on the style of the presenter as well as audience participation.

There is a self-guided or host-guided [workshop], with detailed explanations about the principles of operating an application in a Kubernetes environment. Including some time for setup, this should take between 2-4 hours.

[automated scripts]: ./presentation/scripts
